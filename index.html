   <h2>Intro</h2>
   <p>Hi there and welcome to my website. My name is John Sengson and I am a student at EDA.</p>
   <p>This is my first ever website and I am creating this as part of my curriculum.</p>
   <p>I have blogs about my time studying, share some of my values, and hopefully later on videos and photos of my time in EDA.</p>
   <p>I hope you enjoy your visit and take your time reading my blogs. Not the best but a good read nonetheless.</p>
