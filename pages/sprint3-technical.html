          Difference between HTML and CSS:
        </P>
        <p>
            To know the difference we need to know that they both make, a website.
        </p> 
        <p>
            So think of website as your home.
        </p>
        <p>
            HTML is the foundation which are the walls, bedroom, toilet, doors etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            CSS is what define the sizes of the rooms for example, design, and layout of the whole house.

            Control Flow and loop:
        </P>
        <p>
            Control flow is the order in which individual statements, instructions or function calls of an imperative program are executed
        </p>
        <p>
            A loop is a sequence of statements which is specified once but which may be carried out several times in succession
        </p>
        <p>
            So if we look deep within ourselves control flow is like our daily routines.
        </p>
        <p>
            We get up, get ready, get to work or school, spend the day there, go home, rest and sleep for example.
        </p>
        <p>
            Loops are routines we do multiple times a day.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just like the list above , we do those day after day.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also say eating 3 x a day, breathing continuosly, even blinking is like looping.

            DOM- what is it?
        </P>
          <img class= "pix" src= "https://media3.picsearch.com/is?d-TFDYcMog5aXj-oYrSDlFItcj5c68HqVrSr7O-Wne8&height=226" alt="domfast">
        <p>
            Not that Dom!
        </p>
        <p>
            It's this one below:
        </p>
          <img class="pix" src= "https://www.w3schools.com/js/pic_htmltree.gif" alt="realDom">  
        <p>
            The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming API for HTML and XML documents. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.
        </p>
        <p>
            The image above is how the DOM will interpret a HTML document.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you look at the images below, the left side is me using the DOM on a website
        </p>
        <p>
            The right side is the page after some manipulation with the DOM.

            Arrays and objects differences:
        </P>
        <p>
            Both arrays and objects are ways of grouping pieces of data together into meaning collections.
        </p>
        <p>
            They differ however because an array is used to store a group of values in order, called elements, and can access them through their sequence.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can retrieve information about the elements base on their position in the array.
        </p>
        <p>
            So let's treat a library as an array. There are aisles for book type, titles, chapters, and pages.
        </p>
        <p>
            So if you need to read the ending of a book you like, you will first  go to the correct aisle first base on the type, then look for the title, and then go through the contents of that book.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the other hand, you can access data on an object through properties of the values.
        </p>
        <p>
            Still thinking of the library, let say takapuna library as the name, place is takapuna, car park spaces is 60.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you ask for its name it will tell you its assigned name property of takapuna.

            What are functions?
        </P>
        <p>
            Functions is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
        </p>
        <p>
            It needs to be called/ invoke for it to be executed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Think of like a math equation. The task is to add a+b.
        </p>
        <p>
            It will always stay like the equation unless you ask for the answer.
