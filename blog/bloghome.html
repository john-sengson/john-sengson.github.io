            Quick Intro about myself:
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm John Sengson. A proud kiwi that grew up from the Philippines. I came to follow my family here in NZ back in 2001. Met a wonderful Samoan lady and blessed with 2 young healthy kids. Im currently a student at <a href="https://devacademy.co.nz/">EDA</a>.

          <p>
            I was in the retail industry for the last 15+ years. I felt that I need a change in my life and career. I always have interest in computers and pursued a new path with EDA. Leaving retail for web development was a tough decision, not just because I only have limited coding knowledge but also I am my family's bread winner. This is my journey as a student, a dad, and an aspiring web developer, all at a young age of 35!

          <p class="title">Sharing my experience:</p>
          <p>
            This is my official blog page. I will write about my experience as a full time student in EDA Auckland Campus.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am a very frank person. Sometimes I can come across too straight forward. So just a warning, what your about to read is no holds barred/ censorship reading material. Don't get your hopes too high expecting a novel prize winner article either. I mean that what you read is basically what I will say as if we are having a convo. That's the real essence of a blog- raw and unedited.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have been following me from day 1 , you may notice this page gradually change in layout and contents. This is because this, along with my EDA pages will improve/ change base on what I learn. Putting it simply, it means my page will improve in visuals, responsiveness, and accessibility. It makes me excited just thinking about it! I hope you enjoy the pages I made as much as I do.
