       <h2>1.Describe your core personal values.</h2>
         <ul>
          <li class="question">Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make.</li>
          <p class="answer">I was working as a Duty Manager at the time in a supermarket. I was doing my normal rounds around the shop when I saw one of the department managers chatting with another staff just before the exit towards the retail area.
            There was a working table where there are nuts/ lollies in plastic beside them. They are left behind by customers who didn't want to purchase them anymore. The manager took one of the bags and ate some of the peanuts in one of the bags and handed some to his staff. As a company policy, no food or items are to be consumed or taken home unless approved by our Store Manager or Duty Manager in his absence. I went and approach the manager and advised him its not right for him to consume the nuts. It was only a small amount but there was the decision to make. Should I report this to my Store manager or should I just let it go as it's only a small amount?</p>
          <li class="question">Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</li>
          <p class="answer">Thinking about the past and remembering the amount of people that were in the same position and were disciplined, I decided to advise my boss of the matter.
            In my mind if it's only a small amount now, it will get worse later on if no one will have reported it. My conscience will always hunt me as I had people before that I didn't report for small things as well. Those people end up costing the business more loss. Later I found out they were stealing way more items than I thought they did.</p>
          <li class="question">Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</li>
          <p class="answer">I always thought of myself as being honest and always by the book. Part of my duties within my role at the time was implementing and making sure everyone adhere to company policies. I was just following what was meant to be done as per procedure.
            This was one of the hardest decision I have to make work wise as it does not involve just the person concerned but my reputation as well.</p>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.Describe your strengths and limitations.</h3>
         <ul>
           <li class="question">Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</li>
           <p class="answer">Growing up from the Philippines, part of our culture is exposing us early to good values. We even had a curicullum which is just for Values (good manners and right conduct). Our culture made me aware of the different values and made sure we practice them. </p>
           <li class="question">Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development.</li>
           <p class="answer">My biggest strength is probably being hardworking and a team player. Unfortunately they are my weaknesses too as I tend to over commit to what I do which can affect my family/ home life. 
            Also even though I was recognised as a leader and buddy/ trainer, I often was stuck mentoring rather than moving up the ladder. 
            In saying that, there is satisfaction in me when I see people succeed specially if you have a hand in it.</p>
           <li class="question">Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</li>
           <p class="answer">Being hardworking and committed will surely make it easier to study. As long as I don't overdo it as I tend to focus on given tasks that I forget to eat or will finish really late.</p>
           <li class="question">Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension.</li>
           <p class="answer">There was a time were I was leading a team of around 8-10 people and I had to implement and train them about a new system. The system was made to make it easier for us to work by making some tasks obsolete but introducing new ones at the same times.
            Personally it was hard for me at first as I had to learn it fast and teach it to all my team members. As per every workplace some are oppose to the change and some thinks that what they do now is more effective.
            </p>
           <li class="question">Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</li>
           <p class="answer">I was also hesitant at first as I know I do a good job ordering stock. Being made automated, I didn't think that it was the way to go myself.
            But as per my role I had to implement it so I focus on learning the system and understand it well before I judge it. Buying in to the new initiative myself was my first step.
            In the end because I knew most of the system and its upside, I was able to deliver it to the rest of the team. I even managed to make some notes for my staff which were bullet points from the folder of training module.
            This made it easier for them to make the transistion. Unfortunately I still had to deal with one's who couldn't catch up with the rest. From this experience I learnt to be more open to new initiative. Just because I was comfortable at doing something there will always be something better or easier way. I am now open to the thought of ongoing learning and self improvement. </p>
