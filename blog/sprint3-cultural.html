          <li class="question">What is Emotional Intelligence?</li>

          <li class="question">How is it different to IQ?</li>
          <p class="answer">EQ and IQ differ. Emotional intelligence is about identifying emotions where intelligence is about academic abilities. EQ will identify people with traits like empathy while IQ identifies the one who are smart and do well on tests.</p>

          <li class="question">Why is it important?</li>
          <p class="answer">EQ is important because it is a better indicator of success in a workplace and is used to identify leaders and good team players. 
            Having someone who is intelligent may do well on tasks but having someone with empathy makes a workplace have a better culture.  Having a combination of both will be ideal of course.</p>
