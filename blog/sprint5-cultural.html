         <h2>Utilising your journal findings and the high level overview of the Core learnings you have covered in Foundations - answer each of the following questions:</h2>
           <ul>
             <li class="question">
               What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
             </li>
               <p class="answer">
                 There are a lot of things that I realized about myself while doing the foundation core learning. If I was to name three then one of them is being able to be fully commited. I don't mean I was committed before , I meant that I feel that I manage to improve to that aspect of myself.
                 I'm motivated and happy with my current progress. 
                 Secondly, I think that I learn to listen properly. The listening loop core made me realize how much I cut out people when they are speaking as I always ask questions or because I wish to speak my mind. You can say it's one of my faults. Having able to listen for 2 minutes without interupting somebody is something I haven't done in a while. 
                 Lastly, I think the last sprint core about growth mindset is something that I wasn't expecting that I could do. I mean if you will look at my last study life, last time I was studying was in 2007 and that was part time while I was working. To be honest I was scared that I wouldn't be able to grasp and retain new information compared to when I was younger. 
               </p>
             <li class="question">
               What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?
             </li>
               <p class="answer">
                 There has been a significant change in the mindset of how industries see their people nowadays. Few years ago most companies will go for staff that are skilled and intelligent. Values, emphaty, and even self awareness are not a priority for any potential candidates.
                 As time went by, specially in the last few years the culture has change and still continue to change. Most work place , specially in programming, have cultures that develops one's values. Companies don't just look staff now, even potential employees will sort out the ones with a record of having great culture.
                 It is important to have learning facilities such as schools, universities, and campuses to have material and resources that makes any student be prepared for what is ahead of them.

             <li class="question">
               What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
             </li>
               <p class="answer">
                 What surprised me the most is how much I never actually looked at myself and what I can be capable of. I am always sticking to what I know and a person who hardly take risk. Even if I do it will be a calculated one.
                 I have seen myself in a different way and I can actually say that I have a better understanding of myself. I never expected as said said above that I can actually study and learn again, I have a different mindset , and I continue to change. 
                 5 weeks ago you will have been seeing a man who thinks what he knows is enough about himself. Even though I have a culture that embodies me with values, having to reflect at myself is something that I now have been doing regularly and I'm grateful for to do more often.

             <li class="question">
               What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
             </li>
               <p class="answer">
                 The most challenging aspects of core learning in my opinion is being true to oneself. By doing all the core materials, it makes you keep reflecting upon yourself. Admitting to oneself that you need to improve or change is also challenging. 
               </p>
             <li class="question">
               Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
             </li>
               <p class="answer">
                 I think I have answered this already above. Dev Academy is making sure that all students are ready for what is ahead. They understand the industry and where it currently is. At the moment most employers are looking for people who are bit of both worlds, tech savy and have good values.  
                 Having core learning as part of curriculum is something the programming industry needs. Students need to be able to understand and reflect upon themselves as the role they may get will require constant learning, communication, and team work.
                 Programming and web development changes and improves daily. And because of this having us understand growth mindset, being resourceful, being able to listen and work with a pair/team, reflect and know your own strengths and limitations is crucial to any web developer/ programmer.
               </p>  
             <li class="question">
               Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.
             </li>
               <p class="answer">
                 I think the core material is a crucial part of learning programming. It makes us students be well prepared and be equipped to adjust to whatever the ever changing programming industry takes us. So I say to all my cohorts = "Bring it on!"
