         <h2>Utilising your journal findings and the high level overview of the Core learnings you have covered in Foundations - answer each of the following questions:</h2>
           <ul>
             <li class="question">
               What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
             </li>
               <p class="answer">
                 There are a lot of things that I realized about myself while doing the foundation core learning. If I was to name three then one of them is being able to be fully commited. I don't mean I was committed before , I meant that I feel that I manage to improve to that aspect of myself.
                 I'm motivated and happy with my current progress. 
                 Secondly, I think that I learn to listen properly. The listening loop core made me realize how much I cut out people when they are speaking as I always ask questions or because I wish to speak my mind. You can say it's one of my faults. Having able to listen for 2 minutes without interupting somebody is something I haven't done in a while. 
                 Lastly, I think the last sprint core about growth mindset is something that I wasn't expecting that I could do. I mean if you will look at my last study life, last time I was studying was in 2007 and that was part time while I was working. To be honest I was scared that I wouldn't be able to grasp and retain new information compared to when I was younger.

             <li class="question">
               What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?
             </li>
               <p class="answer">
                 There has been a significant change in the mindset of how industries see their people nowadays. Few years ago most companies will go for staff that are skilled and intelligent. Values, emphaty, and even self awareness are not a priority for any potential candidates.
                 As time went by, specially in the last few years the culture has change and still continue to change. Most work place , specially in programming, have cultures that develops one's values. Companies don't just look staff now, even potential employees will sort out the ones with a record of having great culture.
                 It is important to have learning facilities such as schools, universities, and campuses to have material and resources that makes any student be prepared for what is ahead of them.

             <li class="question">
               What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
             </li>
               <p class="answer">
                 What surprised me the most is how much I never actually looked at myself and what I can be capable of. I am always sticking to what I know and a person who hardly take risk. Even if I do it will be a calculated one.
                 I have seen myself in a different way and I can actually say that I have a better understanding of myself. I never expected as said said above that I can actually study and learn again, I have a different mindset , and I continue to change. 
                 5 weeks ago you will have been seeing a man who thinks what he knows is enough about himself. Even though I have a culture that embodies me with values, having to reflect at myself is something that I now have been doing regularly and I'm grateful for to do more often.

             <li class="question">
               What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
             </li>
               <p class="answer">
                 The most challenging aspects of core learning in my opinion is being true to oneself. By doing all the core materials, it makes you keep reflecting upon yourself. Admitting to oneself that you need to improve or change is also challenging.

             <li class="question">
               Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
             </li>
               <p class="answer">
                 I think I have answered this already above. Dev Academy is making sure that all students are ready for what is ahead. They understand the industry and where it currently is. At the moment most employers are looking for people who are bit of both worlds, tech savy and have good values.  
                 Having core learning as part of curriculum is something the programming industry needs. Students need to be able to understand and reflect upon themselves as the role they may get will require constant learning, communication, and team work.
                 Programming and web development changes and improves daily. And because of this having us understand growth mindset, being resourceful, being able to listen and work with a pair/team, reflect and know your own strengths and limitations is crucial to any web developer/ programmer.
               </p>  
             <li class="question">
               Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.
             </li>
               <p class="answer">
                 I think the core material is a crucial part of learning programming. It makes us students be well prepared and be equipped to adjust to whatever the ever changing programming industry takes us. So I say to all my cohorts = "Bring it on!"

             <li class="question">
              What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
             </li>  
              <p class="answer">
                My long term goal is to be able to progress within the web development industry. I joined Dev Academy so I will be job ready once it's all completed. I wish to transfer the skills that I learn into the workforce. 
                To be honest I am not a 100% sure yet what is all that is required to be a web developer yet. I will need to get thorugh bootcamp too have a better understanding. So instead of looking long term I am looking at short term first. 
                I wish to be able to hopefully join a company that has a culture for developing values and also staff training.
                Web development evolves as time goes by and I wish to be able to be apart of a team that helps me get trained and grow more.

             <li class="question">
              What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?
             </li>  
              <p class="answer">
                I think my biggest strength is being able to work well with a team. As long as I learn all what is required then I will be able to share and do my part with full confidence.
                Unfortunately I am the kind of person that always process information within my mind brain the moment I get it. This means for example I am talking to someone , I will always ask questions base on what the other person says. 
                In short I talk a lot. I learnt from an earlier sprint that by just listening attentively, I can actually get more information and store it within my brain. By letting another person speak and not cut them off all the time, the other person can freely tell me everything.
                It's something I am currently working on right now.
              </p>
             <li class="question">
              What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
             </li>  
              <p class="answer">
                I think my biggest challenge coming in to boot camp is not having that confidence yet to be actively participating on anything really. Because of my lack of skills I am not that comfortable putting myself out there.
                So for example if I was to be on a team, I most likely wont put my hand up to be a leader. I will be more of a follower. Others might think that I'm not the kind who wants to step up. 
                Another example will be what I faced in foundation. Even if I have finished my blogs or challenges, I wont share unless other have first. Hope that make sense.
              </p>
              <li class="question">
                What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?
             </li>  
              <p class="answer">
                I wish to be able to improve on my listening skills as I mentioned above already. I need to be able to process information first rather than going hundred miles an hour and misunderstand things.
                I also want to gain the confidence to be able to present something without stressing too much. Seeing the previous students in bootcamp having a chance to go upfront and share in class, I know that I can work on this and hopefully not make a fool of myself when it's my turn.
              </p>
              <li class="question">
                What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp
             </li>  
              <p class="answer">
                Going to be in a class environment is something I am looking forward to. From what I have seen so far from whenever I go to campus, the days are pretty structured. I am a person who likes to plan ahead and be on a routine.
                It will be a challenge for me if I can keep up with all my plans and goals as I know that boot camp can be pretty full on. There is a lot to process and learn so I may be short on time which can affect what I routinely should do.
                I see myself struggling but just like foundations, I will set myself timeframe to see if I can get over hurdles myself. If I dont make it then I will ask for help then. I need to work on that as asking for help is something I am not use to. 
                I learnt from this past 2 sprints that it's ok to ask and dont leave it too late thinking I can figure things out for myself.
