       <h2>Answer reflection questions.</h2>
         <ul>
          <li class="question">What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</li>
          <p class="answer">My goal is to be a successful web developer. I have commited myself to complete my learning in EDA and then have a junior developer role in a good company.
            I wish to move my way up to be a senior web developer. I will be on the lookout also for any training available to get to do another avenue which is to be a programmer.
            </p>
          <li class="question">What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</li>
          <p class="answer">I wish to learn how to be confident in public speaking. The tought of having myself upfront of people is scary for me. 
            I also wish to be able to give feedback in a good manner. I am a very straight forward person and sometimes I can come out misunderstood.
             </p>
          <li class="question">A description of your own strengths and limitations</li>
          <p class="answer">I feel that I am a very approachable person. I can communicate easily with anyone and is a team player. 
            I am very committed once I focus on a task/job. That is also my downfall as I tend to over commit and stay longer even when not needed and have less family time.
            I am never a 9 to 5 type of guy you see. I will go home when I "feel" that I have done enough for the day.
            </p>
           <li class="question">Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</li>
           <p class="answer">I very much have commited myself to following a set routine. I have read up on the student-prep and it gave me a lot of ideas. I have started writing journals to set goals and reflect daily. 
            I use time apps such as toggl and try to stick to time boxes or my own time goals. In this way I dont feel burnt out and I get to see my progress. Having frequent breaks away from the screen (pomodoro break) helps.
            Having that time away from screen shows that I can break down tasks and manage my time accordigly.</p>
           <li class="question">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</li>
           <p class="answer">As mentioned above I follow goals daily. If I made mistakes or stuck, I will set myself a period amount of time to find the answers.
            The time will vary of course base on where I stand in terms of my progress in my current task. If by the set time expired and I can't find any solution via resources I have (google, own notes, cheat sheets), then I will seek the help of my facilitator or cohorts. Slack is good for this as there are different channels I can try and get asssitance from.</p>
           <li class="question">A description of what you expect from the facilitation team.</li>
           <p class="answer">I expect the facilitation team to deliver to what was presented over by my interview, student-prep, and foundations/ bootcamp. EDA come across as one of the best in the business in terms of learning due to its accelerated way, flip classroom, skills over knowledge, and unobtrusive assessment models. There is also a big focus on values which is something I really look forward to. I have been in retail for roughly 15 years and I always choose to work where there is great culture that focuses on values. Even though I have lived for 35 years and think that I know myself, I expect to complete my journey with EDA with a better understanding and be an improved version of myself, tech and personality wise.</p>
           <li class="question">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. Itâ€™s important to plan these in.</li>
           <p class="answer">I understand the way of learning and the accelerated pace that this course requires. Even before I applied I have commited myself to doing this full time. I have the support of my family.
            I actually have only studying planned for the next 14 more weeks. I had my finances sorted with studylink, got my car wof and even had a doctors check up before foundation starts. I made sure everything was in place so all I will do is focus on my studies. Foundation is good as I can study remotely and still help out at home with kids drop off and pick ups. I plan to do the small things for them as for when boot camp starts it will be all hands on deck. Its just the "unexpected" that can be an issue for me.
