         <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
           <ul>
             <li class="question">
               Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people:
             </li>
               <p class="answer">
                 Neuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to adapt. When we learn something new, we create new connections between our neurons. Our brains are wired to adapt to new circumstances. Knowing this, we can look at neuroplasticity as a way of optimising our brain with new learning. It also enable a person to be able to recover from disabilities or injuries.

               Discuss how might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit:
             </li>
               <p class="answer">
                 By understanding what it means, I now know of what I am capable of. By practicing different things I can accustom myself to do things to help me with my learning. And with new learning, commitment,motivation, and focus comes into play as well. Having to know that we are capable of learning , I feel like it can boosts these traits.
               </p>
             <li class="question">
               What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?
             </li>
               <p class="answer">
                 Repition is key in my opinion. By doing things over and over I get to familiarise myself with what I'm learning as it stimulates my brain and retains it in my memory better as it is accessed most of the time.

         <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
           <ul>
             <li class="question">
               Discuss what it is and why it is relevant:
             </li>
               <p class="answer">
                 A person with a growth mindset believe that their talents can be developed. This is different from a fixed mindset where a person thinks that they their talents are innate traits. Individuals with growth mindsets tend to achieve more than its counter part. They also are not afraid to learn new things and put effort when they get stuck rather than not having to commit at all as they know they won't succeed.
               </p>  
             <li class="question">
               In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?
             </li>
               <p class="answer">
                 As I do more reading and research about growth mindset, the more I reflect back about myself. The more I learn , the more I think that I may not be on the right mindset all the time. There are times when I feel fixed rather than have growth. Just thinking about sprint 3 reminds me of the times I could have done some things better just by having the right mindset.
               </p>
             <li class="question">
               How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?
             </li>
               <p class="answer">
                 I believe that for every new thing you learn you will have a different mindset. By continuing to reflect upon myself while learning I get to know when I tend to have a fixed mindset and work on improving on that. Yes, that means I don't always have a growth mindset. By doing this course a lot will be new to me. Embracing the fact that I will gain more skills and achievement helps in my motivation and commitment to complete this course.
